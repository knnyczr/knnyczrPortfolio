# 👋 Hello nosey developer
  My name is Kenneth Cruz, I'm a plant dad 🍀 , dog dad 🐶, and aquarium enthusist 🐠. (and yes I love using emojis)<br><br> 
  I'm from native New Yorker, I'm a graphic designer and software engineer. This is the source code for my personal portfolio, it provides a collection of my work, sculpture, print work, branding, UX/UI work and developer work.

## 😈 Gatsby!
I love JavaScript! React is my main go-to tool. So I decided to work with Gatsby to showcase my work's collection. Gatsby provides lots of new age tools that spiked my interest–more to come on this topic.
